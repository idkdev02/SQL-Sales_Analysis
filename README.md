This project involves the analysis of datasets, comprising multiple tables, from a pizza outlet's sales over a year. Core SQL concepts and queries were applied to address a range of both simple and complex challenges related to the sales data, including identifying sales trends, understanding customer behavior, and evaluating product performance.
